The reports indicate that some detainees are held for long periods of time under inhumane conditions, lacking sufficient nutrition, proper sanitary facilities, access to legal counseling, or even contact with family members. The reports also discuss cases of medical negligence concerning the treatment of detainees with serious health problems. In one case, a detainee told authorities he was suffering from severe chest pain, profound shortness of breath, and dizziness, and asked for immediate medical attention. However, these situations require supervised transportation to a hospital several miles away from the detention center. In response, detention center officials denied the detainee this medical service because they considered him to be a flight risk. The officials said they had a reasonable cause to deny medical attention outside the facility. The detainee, on the other hand, said that the denial of medical attention was unwarranted and that his health was continuing to deteriorate.‚Äù Do you think the government should transport this illegal migrant to the hospital, at the risk of enabling him to escape?

There have been recent examples of illegal immigrants coming from Africa to ""claim asylum"" (not following international law either which states those seeking asylum should seek it from the first ""safe"" country). Also currently occuring in Africa is yet another Ebola outbreak. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see how that could lead to some extremely serious consequences for American citizens. Second of all, encouraging more and more illegal immigrants to come with promises of utopia, creates an underclass of people who have to live in the shadows of society and are at constant risk of being taken advantage of because they often fear going to authorities for any reason. Thirdly, the insanity of current political extremists in offering everything from free education to free healthcare only incentivizes even more immigrants to come illegally...meanwhile American citizens, who these extremists claim to represent, suffer. For example, in California, healthcare is now being offered to some illegal immigrants while American citizens are quite literally living on and defecating in the streets. Perhaps those resources could be better used to actually help the homeless? Finally, it's extremely unfair that millions go through the VERY long and difficult process of immigrating legally while others just jump the line, cross the border and expect to be handed citizenship. And I say all of this as the child of immigrants. The claim by political extremists that somehow this is all about the color of everyone's skin is beyond ignorant, anti-intellectual, doesn't actually solve anything, in fact makes the situation worse and...ironically....perpetuates racism and the view that skin color is more important than anything else. I realize it's very trendy these days to be completely led by emotions and not think about any issues beyond political talking points, but I prefer to stay in the realm of reality."

My grandparents came to this country legally. I live in a city that was over run with gang members before President Trump came along. We had drive by shootings and Haitians knifing S. Americans in our alleys. We still have spanish people in our neighborhood, lots of them, but they are people who came here legally and are also glad the gang member illegals are no longer menacing them. The schools were over run with illegals: there were kids pooping on the floors, it was awful. I'm a teacher and so is my  older sister.  Kids in the schools who were here illegally, had extreme behavior problems. The illegal Haitian kids were put in classes that met their academic capabilities  but not their ages, so we had 13 year olds in 4th grade classes. Without laws and borders, Florida was the cocaine capital of the USA. When Fentanyl started showing up we had people literally LYING in the streets, overdosing. Much of that is gone now that Trump is enforcing immigration laws. It's a relief for my family and my community. My zip code is 33460. Look at the past crime statistics. It is because this was a low rent are and illegals lived 6-10 men to a house. Without a gun in my house, my wife and I would be dead today, an illegal broke into our house to rob us but saw our rifle and retreated. I do not want to see America go the way of Cuban socialism. I have relatives there now, that are farming ostriches to survive. People fleeing to this country are fleeing socialist countries.  If they are allowed here illegally, they will overrun the local populations and turn area's into lawless drug havens. I know I've lived it. Oh and if someone is here illegally they have no right to complain about holding conditions, food etc. Role reverse into mexico and illegals would be jailed indefinitely if not outright murdered. "

I can't just show up in Denmark and say, ""I want to live here, so hook me up.""  It doesn't work that way.   If an individual from Costa Rica thinks that Costa Rica sucks, then they should work towards improving life in Costa Rica.   I honestly don't even see the attraction.  Is central America really that backwards that coming to America is that attractive?   This country fought a revolution and a civil war to change things.  Maybe all of the people who are coming up from the south could actually put a little effort into improving their lives and making change, or fighting for it where they are.  The idea of a relatively large group of people wanting to freely move around the world gradually screwing it up over time is kind of a turnoff to me."

I have some venting to do. I am starting to wonder if my relatively sane brain is atypical among white people-in particular other white males. Illegal immigration probably would be in the 90's on my list of the 100 most important problems for the US to tackle. The body of research is pretty clear: illegal immigrants do not commit crimes at higher rates than the general population, they contribute significantly to the economy/pay taxes, and they are not stealing any jobs that us citizens want to actually do; rather, that is automation and outsourcing. It is pure racism and xenophobia. I am really starting to believe that white people care more about racism and ""hurting the right people"" than their own economic well being. Look at the businesses and individuals affected by Trump's ludicrous trade war. Many of them will still vote for him in 2020. There is clearly something wrong with their brains. I think fox news and the bat shit crazy right wing propaganda machine in general has turned people into raving lunatics.   I imagine it is worse than I can even fathom. People in power have started to mainline their own product and base policy on fox and friends. I have read Altemyer's work on the authoritarian mindset and I believe it helps to explain the irrational, hypothetical, compartmentalized thinking of Trump supporters. I don't think our society will survive the next couple decades. It is only going to get worse and we are going to collapse into a dystopian nightmare. "
